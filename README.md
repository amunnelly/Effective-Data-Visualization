**Summary**This is a visualization of part the 2008 flight data set. The visualization shows two features of the dataset – the busiest airports in terms of flights, and the airports with the greatest flight delay. As there are over one million records in the original data set, the data set had to be processed before the visualization was created.**Design**The first design decision was to pre-process the data, to assist both load times and to filter the amount of airports in the data set to a manageable amount. D3’s `.filter()` function could have been used to reduce the airport count, but so large a `.csv` would have led to a painfully slow visualization.The dataset was processed to filter out all airlines other than United Airlines, and to only use flights from Day 6. Even then, the data set is still considerable.For the first iteration, it was decided to post the flights against the airports on the axes, and use color to illustrate the departure delay times.**Feedback**From KU: “*Those colors are hideous – change them, for God’s sake.*”From SJ: “*The x-axis labels are misaligned – they’re running off the end of the axis before the bars on the bar chart.*”**Second Iteration**Colors changed to a white to red gradient, and the background changed to a light blue to make the white stand out.The `dy` and `dx` text attributes tweaked to address the label alignment issue.An extra ten pixels were added to the bottom margin to give some space between the tick and axis labels.**Second Iteration Feedback**From KU: “*Much better colors.*”From RM: “*Why don’t you switch the thing around? Why not use the delays as the major statistic and the flights as the minor? People care more about delays than traffic at an airport.*”**Third Iteration**Average Delay plotted against Airports, and colored by flight.The white to red gradient saw bars disappear towards the end of the graph. The color scheme was changed to address this.** Third Iteration Feedback**From SJ: “*The labels are better, but they’re not informative. If you’re not a regular visitor to Chicago, how will you know what ORD stands for?*”From KU: “*The labels at the bottom are still a bit fiddly – why don’t you turn the whole thing around? Put the airports on the y and the delays on the x?*”**Final Iteration**The pre-processing file was changed to add the airport name to the data using data found here: https://github.com/jbrooksuk/JSON-Airports.The graph axes were switched around as per KU’s suggestion.The graph was further amended by moving the x-axis to the top, and nudging the axis labels towards the top-left corner.The tooltip now gives the airport name and all the data – an extra key was added to the `d3.nest()` data to facilitate this.
